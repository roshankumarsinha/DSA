## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roshankumarsinha/DSA.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
    cd General-DSA-Questions
    ```

3. **Open one of the code files**
   - You can use any text editor or IDE (like VSCode, Code::Blocks, etc.) to open the code files.

4. **Run the code**:
   - Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++).
   - Compile the code using:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp
     ```
   - Run the compiled code:
     ```bash
      ./a.out
     ```
  - You can also run both commands in one line:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp && ./a.out
     ```
