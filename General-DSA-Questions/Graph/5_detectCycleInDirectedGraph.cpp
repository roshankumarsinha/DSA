// Write a function to detect cycle in a directed graph.

// Notes Link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph-using-dfs-g-19/

// Key Concept : "If we revisit a node thatâ€™s already in the recursion stack (recStack), then a cycle exists in a directed graph."

// ðŸ§  Intuition Behind the Condition:
// In a directed graph, we follow one-way paths from a node to its neighbors.
// Now imagine you're doing a DFS traversal starting at some node u.
// You mark u as:
//  a.  Visited
//  b.  Part of the current recursion path (pathVisited)

// You then recursively visit its neighbor v, then neighbor of v, and so on...

// ðŸŽ¯ The moment you reach a node that's already in the current recursion path, it means:
// You started at a node, followed a path, and returned to a node that was already part of the current path.

// Thatâ€™s exactly the definition of a cycle.



// In DFS cycle detection for directed graphs, we maintain:
//  a.  visited[]: to check if a node has been explored at all
//  b.  pathVisited[]: to check if a node is part of the current DFS path

// Now youâ€™re asking:
// Why can't we just use visited[] to detect cycles? Why do we need pathVisited[]?

// ðŸ§  Short Answer:
// Just because a node has been visited before, doesnâ€™t mean visiting it again forms a cycle.
// Example: point 6 to 3
//                1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3
//                â†“       â†‘ 
//                4 â†’ 5 â†’ 6
// It couldâ€™ve been visited via a completely different path, and going to it again doesnâ€™t mean you looped back.
// But if the node is in the current path (pathVisited) and you revisit it â†’ you looped back before finishing the path â†’ cycle âœ…


// Approach:
// 1. Use DFS to traverse the graph.
// 2. Maintain two arrays:
//    a.  visited[]: to check if a node has been explored at all
//    b.  pathVisited[]: to check if a node is part of the current DFS path
// 3. For each node:
//    a.  If itâ€™s not visited, call DFS on it.
//    b.  In the DFS function:
//      b1.  Mark the node as visited and add it to the pathVisited.
//      b2.  For each neighbor of the current node:
//        b21.  If the neighbor is not visited, call DFS on it.
//        b22.  If the neighbor is in the pathVisited, a cycle is detected.
//      b23.  After exploring all neighbors, remove the node from the pathVisited.
// 4. If no cycles are found after processing all nodes, return false.
