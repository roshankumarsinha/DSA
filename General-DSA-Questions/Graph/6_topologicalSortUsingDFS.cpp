// Write a function to find Topological Sort using DFS.

// What is Topological Sort?
// Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
// Example:
//  5 â†’ 0   4 â†’ 0
//  â†“       â†“
//  2 â†’ 3 â†’ 1

// One possible topological sort is: 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, because:
// Adjacency List Representation:
// 5 â†’ 0
// 5 â†’ 2
// 4 â†’ 0
// 4 â†’ 1
// 2 â†’ 3
// 3 â†’ 1
// so, 5 comes before 0, 4 comes before 0, 2 comes before 3, and 3 comes before 1.

// We can find Topological sort only if there's no cycle in the graph because if there's a cycle, we can't have a linear ordering because if there is cycle, we will have edge from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1, so we can't have a linear ordering.
// We can find Topological sort only if it is a Directed Graph because in an undirected graph, we can't have a linear ordering because there's a edge from 1 to 2 and 2 to 1, so we can't have a linear ordering.


// Approach:
// 1. Perform a DFS
// 2. After visiting all neighbors of a node, push it onto a stack
// 3. Finally, pop all elements from the stack to get the topological order

// ðŸŽ¯ Why Does This Work?
// In DFS:
// 1. You only push a node to the result after exploring all its dependencies
// 2. So by the time you push u, youâ€™ve already handled everything that should come after it
// 3. This naturally gives the topological order when you reverse the finish times.
