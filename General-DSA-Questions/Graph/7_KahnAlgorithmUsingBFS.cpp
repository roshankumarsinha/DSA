// Write a function to find Topological Sort using BFS and this is called Kahn's Algorithm.

// Notes link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/kahns-algorithm-topological-sort-algorithm-bfs-g-22/

// Approach:
// 1. Calculate the in-degree of each vertex.
// 2. Initialize a queue and push all vertices with in-degree 0 into it.
// 3. While the queue is not empty:
//    a.  Pop a vertex from the queue and add it to the topological order.
//    b.  For each of its neighbors, reduce their in-degree by 1.
//    c.  If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, push it into the queue.
// 4. If the topological order contains all vertices, return it.
// 5. If not, return an empty vector (cycle detected).


// üß† The Core Idea: Remove Dependencies Layer by Layer
// Think of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) like a chain of tasks where some tasks must be done before others.
// üß© So imagine:
//    Tasks (nodes) with no prerequisites (in-degree = 0) ‚Üí you can do them right now
//    Once you do one of them, it unlocks the next task (decreases in-degree of its neighbors)
// You keep doing tasks that are currently "unlocked", and gradually unlock more. This is topological sorting ‚Äî a valid linear order of doing tasks.

// üîÑ How the Algorithm Mirrors This:
// 1. Count prerequisites of each node (in-degree)
// 2. Start with nodes that have no prerequisites
// 3. Every time you process a node:
//    a.  You ‚Äúremove it‚Äù from the system
//    b.  You lower the prerequisites of others that depended on it
//    c.  If something now has all prerequisites done ‚Üí it's ready ‚Üí add to queue
// 4. Keep repeating this till you‚Äôve done everything

// Intuition:
// Instead of going deep like DFS, BFS topological sort removes nodes layer by layer starting with nodes that have no incoming edges.
// No incoming edges means no dependencies left for that node and it is independent of any other node.
// So, you can process it right now.
// Think of it like:
//  ‚ÄúWhat can I process right now that no one depends on anymore?‚Äù
